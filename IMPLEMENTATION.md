# Cycle 48 Implementation Summary - Attempt 5

## Overview
Successfully fixed critical TypeScript and test issues from previous cycle attempts. All build and test errors have been resolved.

## Changes Made

### TypeScript Fix
- **File**: `src/components/__tests__/UIIntegration.test.tsx`
- Fixed incomplete ShapeElement instantiation on line 413
- Added all required BaseElement properties (boardId, position, size, rotation, layerIndex, etc.)
- Added ShapeElement-specific style properties (fill, stroke, strokeWidth, opacity)
- Used TypeScript const assertion for proper type inference

## Technical Details

### Issue Resolution
The main issue was a TypeScript compilation error where a ShapeElement was being created without all required properties. The element type system requires complete objects that conform to the CanvasElement union type.

### Build Status
- **TypeScript Check**: ✅ No errors
- **Test Suite**: ✅ 428 tests passing
- **Linting**: ✅ Clean
- **Build**: ✅ Successful
