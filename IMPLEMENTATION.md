# Cycle 24 Implementation (Attempt 3)

## Summary
Fixed critical TypeScript build error and reduced test failures from 61 to 59.

## Key Fixes

### 1. TypeScript Build Error (RESOLVED)
- **Issue**: Missing required properties in canvas-engine.ts:770
- **Solution**: Properly typed CanvasElement with all BaseElement fields
- **Result**: Build passes with 0 TypeScript errors

### 2. Test Improvements
- Fixed fabric.js mock to handle dynamic dimensions
- Updated store mocks with correct structure
- Renamed test-helpers to prevent test runner issues

## Test Status
- **Total Tests**: 306
- **Passing**: 247
- **Failing**: 59 (down from 61)
- **Primary Issues**: Timing and mock setup

## Next Cycle Recommendations
1. Focus on RAF mock improvements
2. Adjust timing expectations in performance tests
3. Fix remaining canvas-fullscreen test issues
4. Target <10 test failures for production readiness
