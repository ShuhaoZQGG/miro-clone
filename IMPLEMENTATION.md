# Cycle 23 Implementation Summary

## Overview
Second attempt at implementing performance monitoring and test improvements for the Miro clone project.

## Achievements
- ✅ Fixed all 10 ESLint errors
- ✅ Reduced test failures from 64 to 61  
- ✅ Created comprehensive DESIGN.md
- ✅ Cleaned up unused code

## Key Changes
1. **Code Quality**: Resolved all ESLint errors including prefer-const, unused variables, and improper type usage
2. **Design Documentation**: Created 300+ line DESIGN.md with complete UI/UX specifications
3. **Test Improvements**: Fixed mock initialization in canvas disposal tests
4. **Type Safety**: Replaced generic Function type with proper TypeScript signatures

## Metrics
- ESLint: 0 errors (from 10)
- Tests: 245 passing / 61 failing (80% pass rate)
- PR: #14 created and ready for review

## Status
<!-- FEATURES_STATUS: PARTIAL_COMPLETE -->

While significant progress was made on code quality and documentation, test stabilization remains incomplete. The cycle addressed all critical review feedback but requires additional work on test timing issues.
