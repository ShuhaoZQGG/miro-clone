# Cycle 37 Implementation Summary (Attempt 12)

## Overview
Successfully implemented database persistence layer and conflict resolution mechanisms for real-time collaboration.

## Key Achievements
1. **Database Integration**: PostgreSQL with Prisma ORM for persistent storage
2. **Caching Layer**: Redis for ephemeral data and performance optimization
3. **Conflict Resolution**: Hybrid OT/CRDT approach for handling concurrent edits
4. **Type Safety**: Fixed all TypeScript compilation errors

## Technical Implementation
- **server/services/database.service.ts**: Complete database service layer
  - Board CRUD operations
  - Element management with Redis caching
  - Collaboration tracking
  - Version control system
  - Session management
  - Activity logging
  
- **server/services/conflict-resolution.service.ts**: OT and CRDT algorithms
  - Operation Transformation for concurrent operations
  - Vector Clocks for distributed consistency
  - Last-Write-Wins Element Set (CRDT)
  - Conflict resolution for create/update/delete operations
  
- **server/websocket-server.ts**: Updated to use database and conflict resolution
  - Integrated database persistence
  - Real-time conflict resolution
  - Element locking mechanism
  - In-memory caching for active boards
  
- **Tests**: 18 passing tests for conflict resolution algorithms

## Architecture Decisions
- Prisma for type-safe database access
- Redis for cursor positions and element locks (with TTL)
- In-memory caching for active boards (30-minute timeout)
- Vector clocks for distributed consistency
- Hybrid OT/CRDT approach for best performance and correctness

## Database Schema
- Users, Boards, Elements, Collaborators
- Board versions for history tracking
- Activity logs for audit trail
- Sessions for authentication

## Status
- All planned features implemented
- Tests passing (18/18 for conflict resolution)
- TypeScript compilation clean
- Ready for review and integration
