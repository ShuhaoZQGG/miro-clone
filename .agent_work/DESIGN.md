Design phase completed. The UI/UX specifications for Cycle 25 have been created in DESIGN.md, focusing on:

1. **Developer Testing Dashboard** - Real-time test monitoring with clear error messages
2. **Performance Overlay** - Draggable FPS/memory/RAF metrics display  
3. **Element Inspector Panel** - Debug canvas elements and their data properties
4. **Error State Handling** - Visual indicators for build errors and test failures

The design prioritizes fixing the critical TypeScript build error and stabilizing the test suite (reducing failures from 59 to <10) while providing better developer tools for debugging and performance monitoring.
