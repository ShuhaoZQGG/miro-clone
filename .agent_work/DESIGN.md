Design phase completed successfully. The UI/UX specifications have been created in DESIGN.md focusing on:

1. **Deployment monitoring dashboard** with real-time status indicators
2. **Build verification interface** showing DataDog removal and test status 
3. **Error monitoring panels** for Sentry integration
4. **Responsive design** for all screen sizes
5. **Accessibility standards** (WCAG 2.1 AA)
6. **Performance targets** (<2s load, <100ms updates)

The CYCLE_HANDOFF.md has been updated with:
- Completed design phase details
- Pending development tasks (DataDog removal as critical blocker)
- Technical constraints and framework recommendations
- Clear implementation priorities for the development phase

The branch has been pushed but the PR (#1) already exists from the planning phase, so the design commit has been added to it.
