Based on the ui-feature-designer agent's analysis, it appears you already have a comprehensive DESIGN.md file that covers all the requirements you mentioned. The agent found that your existing design documentation is production-ready and extremely detailed, including:

- Complete user journey maps
- Detailed interface mockups  
- Responsive design considerations
- Accessibility requirements (WCAG 2.1 AA compliance)
- Interactive element specifications
- Technical integration aligned with your stack

The agent recommends **focusing on implementation rather than additional design work**, since you have an excellent design foundation that just needs to be built against.

**Next steps should be:**
1. Fix the current technical issues (TypeScript errors, test failures)
2. Implement UI components based on your existing design specifications
3. Address the gap between current code and design requirements

Would you like me to help with the technical debt resolution first (as outlined in your PLAN.md weeks 1-3), or would you prefer to focus on implementing specific UI components from your existing design?
