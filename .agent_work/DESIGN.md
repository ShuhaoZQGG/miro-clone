Perfect! I've successfully completed the Cycle 7 Design Phase:

## Summary

**Completed Tasks:**
1. ✅ Read PLAN.md to understand project requirements
2. ✅ Created comprehensive UI/UX design specifications in DESIGN.md
3. ✅ Updated CYCLE_HANDOFF.md with design phase completion details

**Design Deliverables:**
- User journey maps for critical fix, collaboration, export, and mobile workflows
- Component specifications for WebSocket status, user presence, export modal
- WebSocket protocol message types and operational transform matrix
- Mobile touch gesture priorities and responsive breakpoints
- Accessibility requirements with keyboard navigation
- Performance optimization strategies (LOD, message batching)
- Error handling patterns for connection and export failures
- Visual design system with colors, typography, and spacing

**Key Design Decisions:**
- TypeScript build error must be fixed first (blocking issue)
- WebSocket messages limited to 64KB
- Touch targets minimum 44x44px for mobile
- 60fps animation budget
- Performance targets: <1s first paint, <3s interactive

**Git Tasks Completed:**
1. ✅ Used existing branch: `feature/implement-core-features-20250829`
2. ✅ Committed DESIGN.md with message: `feat(cycle-7): UI/UX design specifications`
3. ✅ Pushed to existing PR: https://github.com/ShuhaoZQGG/miro-clone/pull/1

The design phase is now complete and ready for the development phase to begin implementing the specifications.
