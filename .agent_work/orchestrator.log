Vision: continue working on implementing the miro claude: 1. check fix e2e tests, there are 2 failing now; 2. now click start editing, we enter into the broad but the window keeps refreshing: react-server-dom-web…development.js:3423  Server   ⚠ Unsupported metadata viewport is configured in metadata export in /board/[boardId]. Please move it to viewport export instead.

======================================

=== PROJECT-ARCHITECT PHASE - Sat 30 Aug 2025 04:52:46 EDT ===
## Summary

Planning phase for Cycle 16 completed successfully. I've created a comprehensive plan to address the critical issues:

### Key Issues Identified:
1. **2 failing E2E tests** - preventing validation of canvas disposal fix
2. **Canvas refresh loop** - causing continuous re-renders and DOM disposal errors
3. **Viewport metadata warning** - incorrect export location in Next.js

### Architectural Decisions Made:
- **Canvas Lifecycle:** Implement ref tracking to prevent refresh loops
- **E2E Testing:** Use debug mode with verbose logging
- **DOM Safety:** Enhanced parent-child verification before removal
- **Performance:** Target 60fps with zero disposal errors

### Implementation Plan (6 hours total):
- **Phase 1 (2h):** Fix viewport metadata and debug E2E tests
- **Phase 2 (3h):** Resolve canvas refresh loop with stable cleanup
- **Phase 3 (1h):** Comprehensive testing and validation

### Deliverables:
- PLAN.md updated with comprehensive technical approach
- CYCLE_HANDOFF.md updated with planning phase completion
- Branch created and pushed: `cycle-16-fix-e2e-and-canvas-refresh-20250830`

The plan focuses on stability and ensuring the canvas works without refresh loops while achieving 100% E2E test pass rate.
RESULT: Architecture planning completed successfully

=== UI-FEATURE-DESIGNER PHASE - Sat 30 Aug 2025 04:56:44 EDT ===
Design phase completed. Created comprehensive UI/UX specifications in DESIGN.md focusing on:
- Canvas stability and refresh loop prevention
- Responsive layouts for desktop/tablet/mobile
- Accessibility with keyboard navigation and ARIA support
- Performance targets: 60fps, zero disposal errors
- Error recovery flows and DOM safety checks

Pushed to branch `cycle-16-fix-e2e-and-canvas-refresh-20250830`.
RESULT: UI/UX design completed successfully
