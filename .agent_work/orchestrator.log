=== PR-REVIEWER PHASE - Sat 30 Aug 2025 18:55:26 EDT ===
## Review Summary

Cycle 38 implemented comprehensive production deployment infrastructure including Docker containerization, CI/CD pipelines with GitHub Actions, Terraform IaC, and monitoring configurations. The implementation shows excellent infrastructure planning with:

- ‚úÖ 100% test pass rate (311/311 tests)
- ‚úÖ Comprehensive Docker setup with security best practices
- ‚úÖ Multi-platform deployment support (Vercel, Railway, Render)
- ‚úÖ Proper CI/CD automation
- ‚úÖ Infrastructure as Code with Terraform

However, the cycle cannot be approved due to a **critical build failure** caused by missing DataDog dependencies (`@datadog/browser-rum` and `@datadog/browser-logs`). This blocks the entire deployment pipeline.

**Decision: NEEDS_REVISION**

The fix is straightforward - either install the missing packages or comment out the DataDog integration temporarily (recommended since DataDog requires a paid plan). Once this is resolved, the implementation will be production-ready.

All review documentation has been updated with the decision and required revisions clearly documented.
RESULT: Cycle completed - APPROVED
