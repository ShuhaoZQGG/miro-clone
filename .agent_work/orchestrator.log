=== PROJECT-ARCHITECT PHASE - Thu 28 Aug 2025 22:12:05 EDT ===
The project-architect agent has analyzed your Miro clone vision and created a comprehensive project plan. The complete PLAN.md file has been created in your project directory with detailed coverage of:

- **Requirements Analysis**: MVP features, user personas, and prioritization framework
- **System Architecture**: Real-time collaboration design with operational transforms
- **Technology Stack**: Next.js + Fabric.js frontend, Node.js backend, PostgreSQL/Redis storage
- **Project Phases**: 5 phases over 8 months with 20 sprints and clear deliverables
- **Risk Assessment**: Technical, performance, and business risks with mitigation strategies

The plan provides a practical roadmap for building a production-ready collaborative whiteboard platform, starting with core drawing tools and progressing to advanced features like templates, integrations, and enterprise capabilities.
RESULT: Architecture planning completed successfully

=== UI-FEATURE-DESIGNER PHASE - Thu 28 Aug 2025 22:15:25 EDT ===
Perfect! I've successfully created a comprehensive DESIGN.md document for your Miro clone project using the ui-feature-designer agent. The design specification includes:

✅ **Complete user journey maps** for all four personas from your PLAN.md
✅ **Detailed interface mockups** for every major screen and interaction
✅ **Responsive design considerations** for desktop, tablet, and mobile
✅ **WCAG 2.1 AA accessibility requirements** with specific implementation guidance  
✅ **Interactive element specifications** covering all canvas and collaboration features

The design follows a "Invisible Interface, Infinite Possibilities" philosophy and is specifically tailored to your technical stack (Next.js 14+, Fabric.js, Socket.io, Zustand, Radix UI + Tailwind CSS).

Key design highlights:
- Modern three-panel layout with collapsible sidebars
- Real-time collaboration indicators and user presence
- Touch-optimized mobile interface with gesture controls
- Comprehensive keyboard navigation and accessibility
- Performance-conscious design with 60fps canvas interactions

The DESIGN.md file is now ready and can guide your development team through the UI/UX implementation phase of your Miro clone project.
RESULT: UI/UX design completed successfully
