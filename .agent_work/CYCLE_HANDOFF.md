## Current State
- Cycle Number: 49
- Branch: cycle-49-once-merged-20250901-230434
- Phase: review

## Completed Work
- **Planning Phase**: Comprehensive architectural plan created focusing on performance, collaboration, and mobile
- **Key Decisions**: WebGL for rendering, Yjs for CRDT, PWA for mobile approach
- **Prioritization**: P0 focus on performance optimization and advanced collaboration features

## Pending Items
- Design phase needs to create detailed UI/UX specifications for:
  - WebGL canvas rendering interface
  - CRDT conflict visualization
  - Mobile-responsive controls
  - Performance monitoring dashboard

## Technical Decisions
- **Rendering**: WebGL with Three.js for 60fps performance with 2000+ objects
- **Collaboration**: Yjs CRDT library for conflict-free concurrent editing
- **Mobile**: PWA approach with touch gestures and responsive design
- **Backend**: Supabase Edge Functions for CRDT sync and analytics
- **Performance**: Viewport culling and level-of-detail rendering

## Known Issues
- 2 RLS policies still need optimization (analytics_events, billing_events tables)
- Mobile Safari compatibility needs special handling
- WebSocket scaling will require connection pooling

## Next Steps
- Design phase should focus on UI specifications for new performance features
- Create mockups for CRDT conflict indicators
- Design mobile-optimized toolbar and controls
- Plan performance monitoring dashboard layout
