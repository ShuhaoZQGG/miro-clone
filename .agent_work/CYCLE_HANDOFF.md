# Cycle 37 Handoff Document

Generated: Sat 30 Aug 2025 16:33:36 EDT
Updated: Sat 30 Aug 2025 16:45:00 EDT (Attempt 12)

## Current State
- Cycle Number: 37
- Branch: cycle-37-database-persistence-20250830
- Phase: development (completed)

## Completed Work
- Database persistence layer with PostgreSQL and Prisma ORM
- **Development**: Implemented features with TDD (attempt 12)
- Redis caching for real-time data and cursor positions
- Operation Transformation (OT) for conflict resolution
- CRDT implementation with Last-Write-Wins Element Set
- Vector Clocks for distributed consistency tracking
- Integration of database persistence in WebSocket server
- Comprehensive test suite for conflict resolution algorithms
- TypeScript configuration fixes for ES2015+ features

## Pending Items
- Cloud storage integration (AWS S3)
- Production deployment configuration
- Load testing for WebSocket scalability
- Token refresh mechanism for JWT authentication
- Encryption for sensitive board data
- Frontend integration with new database features

## Technical Decisions
- Used Prisma ORM for type-safe database access
- Implemented hybrid approach: OT for operations + CRDT for state
- Redis for ephemeral data (cursors, locks) with TTL
- PostgreSQL for persistent data (boards, elements, users)
- In-memory caching for active boards with 30-minute timeout
- Element locking mechanism to prevent concurrent edits

## Known Issues
- WebSocket server still on separate port (3001)
- No automatic database migration setup
- Missing integration tests with actual database
- Frontend not updated to handle new WebSocket events
- No stress testing for conflict resolution at scale

## Next Steps
1. Set up database migrations with Prisma
2. Configure production deployment (Docker, K8s)
3. Implement AWS S3 for file storage
4. Add load testing suite
5. Update frontend to use new collaboration features
6. Add monitoring and observability (DataDog, Sentry)

<!-- HANDOFF_START -->
## Review Findings (Cycle 37)
- **Completed**: Successfully implemented database persistence with PostgreSQL/Prisma and conflict resolution with OT/CRDT hybrid approach. 364 tests passing with clean TypeScript build.
- **Pending**: Database migrations setup, WebSocket port integration, frontend updates for new collaboration events
- **Technical**: Solid implementation with proper caching strategy (Redis for ephemeral, in-memory for active boards), rate limiting for security, and comprehensive conflict resolution algorithms
