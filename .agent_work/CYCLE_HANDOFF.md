## Current State
- Cycle Number: 46
- Branch: cycle-46-featuresstatus-allcomplete-20250901-180436
- Phase: planning (complete)

## Completed Work
- ✅ Analyzed comprehensive README.md with all core features
- ✅ Reviewed DESIGN.md UI/UX specifications
- ✅ Evaluated IMPLEMENTATION.md (98% tests passing)
- ✅ Updated PLAN.md with architectural decisions for next phases

## Pending Items
- Security: Configure Supabase Auth MFA (TOTP, SMS)
- Performance: Optimize 28 RLS policies with `(select auth.uid())`
- Performance: Implement WebGL renderer for 60fps with 1000+ objects
- Database: Remove 14 unused indexes, add missing foreign key indexes

## Technical Decisions
- Continue with Fabric.js for canvas (WebGL support available)
- Prioritize security hardening before new features
- Focus on performance optimization for production readiness
- Maintain Socket.io + Supabase Realtime hybrid approach

## Known Issues
- Auth MFA not configured (security warning)
- Leaked password protection disabled (security warning)
- RLS performance warnings in 28 policies
- 6 UI integration tests failing (non-critical)

## Next Steps
1. Design phase should focus on security configuration UI
2. Implementation should prioritize MFA setup
3. Add WebGL renderer toggle in settings
4. Create performance monitoring dashboard
5. Prepare for production deployment
