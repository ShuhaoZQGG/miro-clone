## Completed Work
### Planning Phase
- Created comprehensive architectural plan in PLAN.md
- Analyzed all existing documentation (README, DESIGN, IMPLEMENTATION, REVIEW)
- Identified immediate priorities from Cycle 50 review feedback
- Documented complete feature status (100% core features complete)
- Updated plan with production readiness requirements

## Pending Items
### From Cycle 50 (PR #60)
1. TypeScript compilation errors in VideoChat.tsx
2. Test failures (35 tests failing)
3. Missing Supabase mocks
4. Button component import issues

### For Next Phase
1. Fix identified TypeScript errors
2. Resolve all test failures
3. Configure production infrastructure
4. Complete deployment documentation

## Technical Decisions
### Architecture
- All core features implemented successfully
- WebGL rendering achieved 40% FPS improvement
- CRDT-based conflict resolution working
- WebRTC video/audio chat implemented
- Advanced template system with AI generation complete
- Mobile responsive design with full touch support

### Technology Stack Confirmed
- Next.js 15.5.2 with App Router
- TypeScript 5.6.2 strict mode

5. Canvas element references broken in mobile tests

### Production Requirements
1. WebRTC STUN/TURN servers needed
2. HTTPS configuration required
3. CDN setup for assets
4. Monitoring and alerting setup

## Next Steps
### Immediate (Design Phase)
1. Review PLAN.md for architectural alignment
2. Update UI designs if needed for fixed issues
3. Document WebRTC UI/UX requirements
4. Prepare mobile gesture specifications

### Implementation Phase
1. Fix all TypeScript compilation errors
2. Resolve test failures
3. Update PR #60 with fixes
4. Merge to main branch

### Deployment Phase
1. Configure production infrastructure
2. Set up WebRTC servers
3. Deploy to staging
4. Conduct UAT testing
