# Cycle 39 Handoff Document

Generated: Sat 30 Aug 2025 19:00:49 EDT

## Current State
- Cycle Number: 39
- Branch: cycle-39-featuresstatus-allcomplete-20250830-190049
- Phase: planning â†’ design

## Completed Work
### Planning Phase
- Analyzed critical build failure blocking deployment
- Created comprehensive fix and deployment plan
- Identified DataDog dependency issue as root cause
- Designed production deployment architecture
- Established clear implementation phases with timeline

## Pending Items
### For Design Phase
- Review build fix approach (remove DataDog vs install deps)
- Confirm deployment platform choices (Vercel/Railway/Supabase)
- Validate monitoring strategy without DataDog
- Consider UI updates for production deployment status

### Critical Build Fix Required
- DataDog imports must be removed/commented in monitoring/datadog.config.ts
- Missing type-check script needs addition to package.json
- Build verification required before any deployment

## Technical Decisions
### Major Architecture Choices
1. **Remove DataDog**: Requires paid plan, use Sentry instead
2. **Deployment Stack**: Vercel (frontend) + Railway (WebSocket) + Supabase (DB)
3. **Monitoring**: Sentry for errors, UptimeRobot for availability
4. **Redis**: Upstash for WebSocket adapter and caching
5. **Timeline**: 1.5 days total to production deployment

### Technology Confirmations
- Frontend: Next.js 14, React 18, TypeScript, Fabric.js
- Real-time: Socket.io with Redis adapter
- Database: PostgreSQL primary, Redis cache
- Auth: NextAuth.js with JWT tokens
- CDN: Vercel Edge Network

## Known Issues
### Blocking Issues
1. Build failure due to missing @datadog/browser-rum and @datadog/browser-logs
2. Missing type-check script in package.json
3. 24 TypeScript warnings (non-blocking but should fix)
4. Unused token variable in socketio route

### Non-Critical Issues
- No E2E tests implemented
- Some TypeScript any types in test files
- Documentation needs updates for deployment

## Next Steps
### Immediate Actions for Design Phase
1. Create UI mockups for deployment status dashboard
2. Design error states for production scenarios
3. Plan user feedback for monitoring alerts
4. Consider admin panel for deployment management

### Implementation Priority
1. Fix build (remove DataDog) - CRITICAL
2. Deploy to production platforms
3. Configure monitoring
4. Fix TypeScript warnings
5. Update documentation
