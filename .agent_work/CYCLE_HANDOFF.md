Generated: Tue  2 Sep 2025 04:02:38 EDT

## Current State
- Cycle Number: 54
- Branch: cycle-54-all-features-20250902-040239
- Phase: planning (complete)

## Completed Work
<!-- Updated by each agent as they complete their phase -->
- **Planning**: Created architectural plan and requirements
### Planning Phase
- ✅ Analyzed project state and identified critical PR crisis
- ✅ Updated PLAN.md with comprehensive consolidation strategy
- ✅ Documented 13 open PRs with technical debt analysis
- ✅ Created 4-phase PR consolidation plan
- ✅ Identified WebGL architecture conflict requiring decision

### Design Phase
- ✅ Created comprehensive UI/UX specifications in DESIGN.md
- ✅ Designed unified interface for consolidated features
- ✅ Documented responsive breakpoints and accessibility requirements
- ✅ Specified performance optimization strategies
- ✅ Provided framework recommendations aligned with existing stack

## Pending Items
<!-- Items that need attention in the next phase or cycle -->
### Critical Decisions Required
- Choose between PR #57 (Three.js) vs PR #58 (Native WebGL)
- Resolve merge conflicts in PR #60
- Security vulnerabilities in PRs #24, #25 need immediate merge

### Technical Debt
- 13 open PRs with 15,000+ lines of unmerged code
- Multiple conflicting implementations (WebGL, CRDT, mobile)
- Growing merge conflicts daily

## Technical Decisions
<!-- Important technical decisions made during this cycle -->
### Architecture
- Must choose single WebGL implementation (cannot have both)
- CRDT manager needs unified approach
- Security fixes take priority over features

### Process
- No new features until PR consolidation complete
- Maximum 3 open PRs policy going forward
- Daily merge cycles to prevent accumulation

### Design Constraints
- Desktop-first approach with progressive mobile enhancement
- WebGL renderer required for 1000+ object performance
- Supabase Auth integration for security features
- Fabric.js as primary canvas library (existing investment)

## Known Issues
<!-- Issues discovered but not yet resolved -->
### Security
- JWT vulnerabilities (PR #24)
- MFA insufficient (PR #50)
- Leaked password protection disabled

### Testing
- 13 failing tests in mobile-manager
- WebGL renderer tests failing
- Template tests need fixtures

## Next Steps
<!-- Clear action items for the next agent/cycle -->
### For Design Phase
- No new UI designs needed
- Focus on consolidation support only
- Document merged feature interactions

### For Development Phase
1. Execute Phase 1: Merge security PRs (#24, #25)
2. Execute Phase 2: Make WebGL decision and merge
3. Execute Phase 3: Integrate core features
4. Execute Phase 4: Cleanup and validation

### DO NOT
- Create new features
- Start new PRs
- Work on anything not in consolidation plan
