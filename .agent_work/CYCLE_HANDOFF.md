## Current State
- Cycle Number: 49
- Branch: cycle-49-once-merged-20250901-230437
- Phase: design (completed)

## Completed Work
- **Planning Phase**: Comprehensive architectural plan created focusing on performance, collaboration, and mobile
- **Design Phase**: Complete UI/UX specifications with:
  - WebGL rendering system design with Three.js integration
  - CRDT conflict resolution UI with visual indicators
  - Mobile PWA experience with touch gestures
  - Performance monitoring dashboard specifications
  - Updated color palette for performance indicators
  - Detailed implementation phases and timelines

## Design Deliverables
- **DESIGN.md Updated**: Comprehensive specifications for all core features
- **Priority Features Designed**:
  - WebGL performance HUD with real-time metrics
  - Conflict resolution modal with side-by-side preview
  - Mobile-optimized toolbar and gesture controls
  - Performance monitoring dashboard with graphs

## Technical Decisions
- **Rendering**: WebGL with Three.js for 60fps performance with 2000+ objects
- **Collaboration**: Yjs CRDT library for conflict-free concurrent editing
- **Mobile**: PWA approach with touch gestures and responsive design
- **Backend**: Supabase Edge Functions for CRDT sync and analytics
- **Performance**: Viewport culling and level-of-detail rendering
- **UI Components**: Radix UI + existing Tailwind setup
- **PWA Framework**: Workbox for service worker management
- **Monitoring**: Web Vitals API for performance tracking

## Design Constraints for Development
- **Performance**: Must maintain 60fps with 2000+ objects
- **Memory**: Keep under 500MB for large boards
- **Touch Targets**: Minimum 48x48px on mobile
- **Accessibility**: WCAG 2.1 Level AA compliance required
- **Browser Support**: Chrome 90+, Safari 15+, Firefox 90+, Edge 90+

## Frontend Framework Recommendations
- **Keep Existing**: Next.js 15, Tailwind CSS, Zustand, Framer Motion, Fabric.js
- **Add New**: Three.js (WebGL), Yjs (CRDT), Workbox (PWA), Web Vitals API
- **Component Pattern**: Atomic design with compound components
- **Theming**: CSS variables for easy customization

## Known Issues
- 2 RLS policies still need optimization (analytics_events, billing_events tables)
- Mobile Safari compatibility needs special handling
- WebSocket scaling will require connection pooling

## Next Steps for Development Phase
- Implement WebGL renderer with Three.js
- Integrate Yjs for CRDT support
- Build conflict resolution UI components
- Create mobile-responsive layouts
- Add performance monitoring dashboard
- Set up PWA with service worker
- Implement touch gesture handlers
