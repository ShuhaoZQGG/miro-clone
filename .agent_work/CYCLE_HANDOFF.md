# Cycle 41 Handoff Document

Generated: Sat 30 Aug 2025 19:37:49 EDT

## Current State
- Cycle Number: 41
- Branch: cycle-41-âœ…-implemented-20250830-193749
- Phase: design (completed)

## Completed Work
### Planning Phase
- **Design**: Created UI/UX specifications and mockups
- **Planning**: Created architectural plan and requirements
- Fixed TypeScript build error in sentry-production.config.ts (removed staging case)
- Created comprehensive PLAN.md with remaining features and deployment strategy
- Identified missing @sentry/nextjs dependency
- Analyzed project state and feature gaps

### Design Phase
- **Design**: Created UI/UX specifications for remaining features
- Designed conflict resolution UI with CRDT merge indicators
- Specified performance mode with WebGL auto-detection
- Created responsive layouts for desktop/tablet/mobile
- Defined accessibility standards (WCAG 2.1 AA)
- Established visual design system and animation guidelines

## Pending Items
### For Implementation Phase
1. Install @sentry/nextjs dependency
2. Create /api/health route
3. Fix remaining TypeScript errors
4. Implement conflict resolution system
5. Add canvas virtualization
6. Deploy to production platforms

## Technical Decisions
### Architecture Choices Made
1. **CRDT for Conflict Resolution**: Better than OT for distributed systems
2. **WebGL Rendering**: Required for 1000+ object performance
3. **Sentry over DataDog**: Free tier sufficient, DataDog requires paid plan
4. **Railway for WebSocket**: Better real-time support than Render
5. **Keep monorepo structure**: Simpler deployment and maintenance

### Design Constraints for Development
1. **Frontend Framework**: Use existing Next.js/React setup
2. **State Management**: Leverage current Liveblocks integration
3. **Component Library**: Extend existing shadcn/ui components
4. **Styling**: Continue with Tailwind CSS patterns
5. **Canvas Rendering**: Integrate WebGL with current Fabric.js

## Known Issues
### Build Blockers
1. @sentry/nextjs module not installed
2. /api/health route missing
3. TypeScript errors in test files
4. Implicit any types in monitoring config

### Non-Critical
- 24 TypeScript warnings (can be addressed post-deployment)
- Bundle size optimization needed

## Next Steps
### Immediate Actions (Design Phase)
1. Review PLAN.md and confirm feature priorities
2. Create UI mockups for new features if needed
3. Design conflict resolution UX

### Implementation Phase
1. Install missing dependencies
2. Fix all TypeScript errors
3. Implement remaining collaboration features
4. Deploy to staging environment
5. Run comprehensive testing
