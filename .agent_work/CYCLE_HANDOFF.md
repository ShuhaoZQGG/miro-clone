## Current State
- Cycle Number: 29
- Branch: cycle-29-featuresstatus-allcomplete-20250830-121359
- Phase: review

## Completed Work
<!-- Updated by each agent as they complete their phase -->
- **Planning**: Created architectural plan and requirements
### Planning Phase (Cycle 29)
- Analyzed critical TypeScript compilation errors (38 errors blocking production)
- Identified missing features: performance monitoring, persistence, undo/redo, export
- Created comprehensive architectural plan with 4 implementation phases
- Prioritized critical fixes first, then core features, then advanced features

### Design Phase (Cycle 29)
- Created complete UI/UX specifications for all new features
- Designed performance monitoring dashboard with real-time metrics
- Specified save/load workflow with auto-save and cloud sync indicators
- Designed undo/redo system with visual history panel
- Created export modal with format options and preview
- Updated responsive design for desktop, tablet, and mobile
- Defined accessibility requirements and keyboard shortcuts
- Established design system with colors, typography, and spacing

## Pending Items
<!-- Items that need attention in the next phase or cycle -->
### For Implementation Phase
- Implement all UI components specified in DESIGN.md
- Create performance monitoring with <1% CPU overhead
- Build persistence layer with IndexedDB
- Implement Command Pattern for undo/redo
- Add export functionality for PNG/SVG/PDF
- Ensure all keyboard shortcuts work
- Apply design system colors and spacing

### Critical Technical Issues
- InternalCanvasElement interface extension errors must be fixed immediately
- Private method access in tests needs refactoring
- Missing properties on element types blocking compilation

## Technical Decisions
<!-- Important technical decisions made during this cycle -->
### Architecture Choices
1. **Type System**: Fix InternalCanvasElement through proper interface composition
2. **Testing**: Move from private method testing to public API testing
3. **State Management**: Implement Command Pattern for undo/redo
4. **Persistence**: Use IndexedDB for local storage, prepare for cloud API
5. **Performance**: Implement sampling strategy to avoid overhead

### Technology Stack Confirmed
- Next.js 13 with App Router
- Fabric.js for canvas operations
- React Context + Command Pattern for state
- Jest + RTL for testing
- TypeScript strict mode enforcement

## Known Issues
<!-- Issues discovered but not yet resolved -->
1. **38 TypeScript compilation errors** - Critical blocker
2. **Test access patterns** - Need refactoring to public APIs
3. **Performance monitoring** - Currently mocked, needs real implementation
4. **15 failing tests** - Acceptable but should be monitored

## Next Steps
<!-- Clear action items for the next agent/cycle -->
### Immediate Actions for Implementation
1. Fix TypeScript errors in canvas-engine.ts (Priority 1)
2. Refactor test access patterns
3. Implement InternalCanvasElement properties
4. Ensure build and type-check pass

### Technical Constraints for Development
1. Must maintain 60fps during all interactions
2. Performance monitoring overhead must be <1% CPU
3. Auto-save must complete in <500ms
4. Export generation must complete in <2 seconds
5. Memory usage must stay under 200MB
6. All features must be keyboard accessible
