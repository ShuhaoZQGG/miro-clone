## Current State
- Cycle Number: 40
- Branch: cycle-40-featuresstatus-allcomplete-20250830-191807
- Phase: planning → design

## Completed Work
### Planning Phase
- **Planning**: Created architectural plan and requirements
- Analyzed project vision for completing remaining features
- Created comprehensive deployment and optimization plan
- Identified merge conflict resolution as P0 priority
- Defined 4-phase implementation strategy

## Pending Items
### Immediate Actions Required
1. **Merge Conflict Resolution** - PR #31 needs conflict resolution before merge
2. **Production Deployment** - Deploy to Vercel/Railway/Supabase
3. **Monitoring Configuration** - Set up Sentry DSN

## Technical Decisions
### Architecture Choices
- **Frontend Hosting**: Vercel (optimal for Next.js)
- **WebSocket Server**: Railway (better real-time performance than Render)
- **Database**: Supabase PostgreSQL + Upstash Redis
- **Monitoring**: Sentry only (DataDog removed - requires paid plan)

### Implementation Strategy
- Phase 1: Resolve PR #31 merge conflicts
- Phase 2: Deploy infrastructure components
- Phase 3: Configure monitoring and optimization
- Phase 4: Documentation and final verification

## Known Issues
- 24 TypeScript warnings (non-blocking)
- Unused token variable in socketio route
- Multiple open PRs need review (#29, #30)

## Next Steps
### For Design Phase
1. Review deployment UI/UX requirements
2. Design monitoring dashboard interface
3. Plan user-facing deployment status indicators
4. Consider error state presentations

### For Development Phase
1. Execute merge conflict resolution
2. Deploy to production services
3. Configure all environment variables
4. Verify monitoring integration

## Key Metrics
- Build Status: ✅ Passing
- Tests: ✅ 311/311 passing
- TypeScript: ✅ No errors (24 warnings)
- Coverage: 100% test pass rate
- Performance: <5s build time achieved
