## Current State
- Cycle Number: 46
- Branch: cycle-46-featuresstatus-allcomplete-20250901-180436
- Phase: Planning Complete → Ready for Design

## Completed Work
### Planning Phase (Cycle 46)
- **Planning**: Created architectural plan and requirements
- ✅ Created comprehensive README.md with full feature list
- ✅ Updated PLAN.md with architectural decisions
- ✅ Analyzed project state and identified integration gaps
- ✅ Prioritized features for implementation
- ✅ Defined clear success metrics

### Key Findings
- **Build Status**: Clean, zero TypeScript errors
- **Test Coverage**: 408/410 tests passing
- **Integration Gap**: Managers implemented but not connected to UI
- **Critical Path**: UI integration is blocking user access to features

## Pending Items
### Immediate (P0)
1. **UI Integration Required**
   - TextEditingManager needs toolbar button
   - GridSnappingManager needs control panel
   - ImageUploadManager needs upload button
   - Template gallery needs modal implementation

2. **Security Fixes**
   - .env file should be .env.example
   - Supabase Auth MFA configuration pending

### Next Phase (P1)
- WebGL renderer activation
- Viewport culling implementation
- CRDT conflict resolution
- Performance optimizations

## Technical Decisions
### Architecture Choices Made
1. **Manager Pattern**: Confirmed separation of concerns approach
2. **Integration Strategy**: Event-driven connection between UI and managers
3. **State Management**: Centralized tool state with Zustand
4. **Performance**: WebGL + viewport culling for 1000+ objects
5. **Collaboration**: CRDT for automatic conflict resolution

### Technology Stack Confirmed
- Frontend: Next.js 15.5.2 + TypeScript
- Canvas: Fabric.js with WebGL backend
- Real-time: Socket.io + Redis
- Backend: Supabase (PostgreSQL + Auth + Storage)
- Monitoring: Sentry

## Known Issues
### From Previous Cycles
1. **Test Warnings**: 2 Auth configuration warnings (non-blocking)
2. **Integration Tests**: ImageUploadIntegration has 14 failing tests
3. **UI Gaps**: No visible controls for implemented features

### Discovered This Cycle
1. **.env Committed**: Should be template only
2. **Manager Initialization**: Not wired in Whiteboard component
3. **Tool Switching**: No state machine implemented

## Next Steps
### For Design Phase (Immediate)
1. **Create UI Components**
   - Design TextToolButton component
   - Design GridControlPanel component  
   - Design ImageUploadButton component
   - Design TemplateGalleryModal component

2. **Define Interactions**
   - Tool switching behavior
   - Keyboard shortcuts
   - Progress indicators
   - Error states

3. **Plan Integration**
   - Event flow diagrams
   - State management patterns
   - Component hierarchy

### For Implementation Phase
1. Wire managers to Whiteboard component
2. Implement tool state machine
3. Add event listeners for canvas interactions
4. Create integration tests

## Risk Assessment
| Risk | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|--------|-----------|
| UI-Manager disconnect | High | Create integration tests first |
| Performance regression | High | Benchmark before/after |
| Breaking existing features | Medium | Comprehensive E2E tests |
| State sync issues | High | CRDT implementation |

## Success Criteria
- All managers accessible via UI
- Zero TypeScript errors maintained
- Test coverage >90%
- Performance metrics met (<16ms render)
- Features working end-to-end

## Handoff Notes
The design phase has created comprehensive UI/UX specifications addressing all core features with special focus on the integration gaps identified. Key deliverables include component specifications for text tool, grid controls, image upload, and template gallery that need to be connected to existing managers. The design follows a modular approach with clear user journeys and accessibility standards.

## Design Phase Completion
- **Completed**: Full UI/UX specifications with mockups
- **Pending**: Wire managers to UI components in development
- **Technical**: Use existing Fabric.js, maintain WebSocket connections, respect Supabase RLS

## Files Modified
- README.md (created)
- PLAN.md (updated)
- DESIGN.md (comprehensive UI/UX specs)
- CYCLE_HANDOFF.md (updated with design phase)

## Branch Status
- Branch: cycle-46-featuresstatus-allcomplete-20250901-180436
- Ready for commit and push
- Target PR: #1 (existing)
