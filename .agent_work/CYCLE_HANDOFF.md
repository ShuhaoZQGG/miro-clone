## Current State
- Cycle Number: 46
- Branch: cycle-46-ive-successfully-20250901-192352
- Phase: planning

## Completed Work
- Comprehensive architectural planning document (PLAN.md)
- Analysis of current project state and critical issues
- Prioritized implementation phases with clear deliverables
- Risk assessment and mitigation strategies

## Pending Items
- DATABASE_URL environment configuration fix
- Security features enablement (MFA, password protection)
- RLS policy optimization (28 policies)
- Test failure resolution (6 UIIntegration tests)
- Verification of duplicate work (cycle 46 vs PR #49)

## Technical Decisions
- Focus on P0 critical fixes before new features
- Use existing Fabric.js integration
- Maintain manager pattern for separation of concerns
- Prioritize performance optimization over new functionality
- Leverage Supabase MCP tools for database operations

## Known Issues
- Build fails due to missing DATABASE_URL
- Security advisors show multiple warnings
- RLS policies have performance issues (auth.uid() not optimized)
- Multiple unindexed foreign keys affecting queries
- Possible duplicate work from already-merged PR #49

## Next Steps
- Design phase should focus on UI/UX for critical fixes
- Implementation should prioritize environment and security issues
- Consider creating database migration for index optimization
- Verify if new features are needed or already implemented
