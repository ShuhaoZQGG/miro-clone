# Cycle 22 Handoff Document

Generated: Sat 30 Aug 2025 08:37:15 EDT

## Current State
- Cycle Number: 22
- Branch: cycle-22-successfully-implemented-20250830-083715
- Phase: development

## Completed Work
<!-- Updated by each agent as they complete their phase -->
- Planning phase completed with comprehensive architectural plan
- Analyzed current state: 64 failing tests, missing E2E tests, no performance dashboard
- Created 4-phase implementation plan focusing on quality improvements
- Defined clear success metrics and risk mitigation strategies

## Pending Items
<!-- Items that need attention in the next phase or cycle -->
- Should we upgrade test infrastructure or fix existing?
- Custom performance tracker vs third-party solution (e.g., Sentry)?
- Performance dashboard as separate app or integrated component?

## Technical Decisions
<!-- Important technical decisions made during this cycle -->
- Focus on quality over new features for this cycle
- Prioritize test stability (100% pass rate) before new E2E tests
- Use Web Performance API for metrics collection
- Maintain existing tech stack (Next.js 14, Fabric.js, Jest, Playwright)

## Known Issues
<!-- Issues discovered but not yet resolved -->
- 64 failing unit tests (mostly timing/mock related)
- RAF mock setup inadequate for animation tests
- Unrealistic timing expectations in performance tests
- ESLint 'any' type warnings throughout codebase

## Next Steps
<!-- Clear action items for the next agent/cycle -->
- Design phase: Create detailed UI specs for performance dashboard
- Implementation phase: Start with Phase 1 (test fixes) as highest priority
- Consider creating test utilities module for common mock patterns
- Document RAF mock setup patterns for future reference
