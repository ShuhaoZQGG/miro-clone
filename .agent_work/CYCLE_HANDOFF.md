## Current State
- Cycle Number: 34
- Branch: cycle-34-featuresstatus-partialcomplete-20250830-142647
- Phase: review

## Completed Work
<!-- HANDOFF_START -->
- **Development**: Implemented features with TDD (attempt 1)
- **Design**: Created UI/UX specifications and mockups
- **Design Phase**: Created comprehensive UI/UX specifications
- **Design System**: Defined color palette, typography, and component specs
- **User Journeys**: Mapped first-time, collaboration, and creation flows
- **Responsive Design**: Desktop, tablet, and mobile breakpoints specified
- **Accessibility**: WCAG 2.1 AA compliance guidelines defined
- **Development**: Fixed canvas engine test failures and improved test coverage
- **Test Suite**: 296 out of 342 tests passing (86.5% pass rate)
- **Core Components**: AuthModal, CollaborationPanel, Whiteboard components implemented
- **Canvas Engine**: Pan, zoom, and rendering functionality working
- **WebSocket Server**: Basic structure in place for real-time features
- **Review**: Cycle 34 reviewed - NEEDS_REVISION decision made
- **Review Findings**: 46 tests failing, WebSocket incomplete, session management missing
<!-- HANDOFF_END -->

## Pending Items
- **Test Failures**: 46 tests still failing, mainly in canvas disposal and integration tests
- **Canvas Engine**: 4 tests need fixing for pan/zoom render synchronization
- **Authentication**: Route tests need updating for new auth flow
- **Integration Tests**: Whiteboard integration tests need mock updates
- **Performance**: Throttled rendering tests need proper RAF handling
- **WebSocket**: Real-time collaboration features incomplete
- **Session Management**: Authentication session handling not implemented
- **Operation Transformation**: Conflict resolution system pending

## Technical Decisions
- **Frontend Framework**: React 18 with TypeScript
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS for utility-first approach
- **Component Structure**: Atomic design pattern
- **Canvas Library**: Continue with Fabric.js
- **Real-time**: Socket.io for WebSocket management
- **Review Decision**: NEEDS_REVISION - cycle requires completion of critical features

## Known Issues
- Canvas engine render loop synchronization with test mocks
- Some integration tests have outdated mock expectations
- Auth route tests need session management updates

## Next Steps
1. Fix remaining 46 test failures for 100% pass rate
2. Complete real-time collaboration WebSocket implementation
3. Add missing authentication session management
4. Implement Operation Transformation for conflict resolution
5. Add production deployment configuration
