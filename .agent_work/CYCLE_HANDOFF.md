## Current State
- Cycle Number: 34
- Branch: cycle-34-featuresstatus-partialcomplete-20250830-142647
- Phase: review

## Completed Work
<!-- HANDOFF_START -->
- **Review**: Completed with decision: NEEDS_REVISION
- **Development**: Implemented features with TDD (attempt 2)
- **Development (Attempt 2)**: Addressed review feedback from attempt 1
- **Test Improvements**: Reduced failing tests from 46 to 38 (87.5% pass rate, 267/305 tests passing)
- **Canvas Engine**: Fixed test synchronization issues and mock implementations
- **WebSocket Implementation**: Completed real-time collaboration handlers with full event support
- **Operation Transformation**: Implemented conflict resolution system for concurrent edits
- **Session Management**: Added comprehensive session management with JWT and refresh tokens
- **Authentication Enhancement**: Updated auth routes with session support and secure cookies
- **New Routes**: Added /api/auth/logout and /api/auth/refresh endpoints
- **Test Cleanup**: Removed duplicate test files and fixed import paths
- **Performance**: Fixed throttled rendering tests with proper timer mocks
- **Review (Attempt 2)**: Evaluated implementation - NEEDS_REVISION due to 12.5% test failure rate
<!-- HANDOFF_END -->

## Pending Items
- **Test Failures**: 38 tests still failing (12.5% failure rate - needs <5% for production)
- **Canvas Disposal**: Timeout issues in disposal tests causing failures
- **Integration Tests**: Whiteboard integration tests have synchronization issues
- **Auth Route Tests**: Jest environment configuration issue (window not defined)
- **Helper File**: Non-test file in test directory needs to be moved
- **Production Config**: Environment variables need production setup
- **Database**: Needs actual PostgreSQL and Redis setup (using mocks currently)
- **Rate Limiting**: Not yet implemented for API routes
- **CORS Configuration**: Needs production configuration

## Technical Decisions
- **Frontend Framework**: React 18 with TypeScript ✅
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS for utility-first approach ✅
- **Component Structure**: Atomic design pattern ✅
- **Canvas Library**: Continue with Fabric.js ✅
- **Real-time**: Socket.io for WebSocket management ✅ IMPLEMENTED
- **Session Management**: JWT with refresh tokens, httpOnly cookies ✅ IMPLEMENTED
- **Conflict Resolution**: Operation Transformation for concurrent edits ✅ IMPLEMENTED
- **Security**: bcrypt for passwords, secure session cookies ✅ IMPLEMENTED

## Known Issues
- Canvas engine render loop synchronization with test mocks
- Some integration tests have outdated mock expectations
- Auth route tests need session management updates

## Next Steps
1. Fix remaining 38 test failures for 100% pass rate
2. Set up production environment variables
3. Configure actual PostgreSQL and Redis databases
4. Add rate limiting to API routes
5. Configure CORS for production
6. Deploy WebSocket server to production
7. Add monitoring and logging
8. Performance optimization and load testing
