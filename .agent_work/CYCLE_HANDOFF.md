# Cycle 36 Handoff Document

Generated: Sat 30 Aug 2025 16:20:51 EDT

## Current State
- Cycle Number: 36
- Branch: cycle-36-âœ…-added-20250830-162051
- Phase: development (attempt 11)

## Completed Work
- Fixed TypeScript compilation error (Collaborator vs UserPresence type mismatch)
- Added JWT authentication to WebSocket handshake
- Implemented rate limiting middleware for WebSocket events
- Added comprehensive E2E tests for collaboration features
- All build errors resolved
- All tests passing (346/348 passed, 2 skipped)

## Pending Items
- Backend API endpoints for board persistence (PostgreSQL/Redis)
- Operation transformation (OT/CRDT) for conflict resolution
- Cloud storage integration (AWS S3)
- Load testing for WebSocket server
- Production deployment configuration

## Technical Decisions
- Used existing JWT authentication service for WebSocket auth
- Implemented per-event rate limiting with configurable thresholds
- Rate limits: 30 cursor updates/sec, 10 element creates/sec, 20 updates/sec
- Converted Collaborator interface to UserPresence for consistency
- Added automatic cleanup of rate limit data on disconnect

## Known Issues
- No database persistence yet (only in-memory storage)
- No conflict resolution for concurrent edits
- WebSocket server runs on separate port (3001)
- Missing production environment configuration

## Next Steps
- Implement PostgreSQL database integration
- Add Redis for session management
- Implement operation transformation algorithms
- Setup cloud storage for board persistence
- Configure production deployment
