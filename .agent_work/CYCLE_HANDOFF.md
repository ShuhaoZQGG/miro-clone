## Current State
- Cycle Number: 55
- Branch: cycle-55-project-status-20250902-024430
- Phase: planning (completed)

## Completed Work
<!-- Updated by each agent as they complete their phase -->
- **Planning**: Created architectural plan and requirements
### Planning Phase (Completed)
- Analyzed project state: 97.5% feature-complete (593/608 tests passing)
- Identified critical blocker: 13 open PRs creating technical debt
- Created comprehensive 12-day deployment plan in PLAN.md
- Prioritized PR consolidation over new development
- Defined security hardening requirements
- Outlined production deployment strategy

### Design Phase (Completed)
- Reviewed existing DESIGN.md with comprehensive UI/UX specifications
- Confirmed all 600+ core features have UI designs
- Validated Supabase database schema alignment with UI components
- Identified production deployment UI requirements
- Verified responsive design and accessibility standards

## Pending Items
<!-- Items that need attention in the next phase or cycle -->
### Critical Priority
- Review and merge/close 13 open PRs (#60, #58, #57, #51, #50, #45, #44, #42, #25, #24, #20, #16, #10)
- Enable Supabase security features (MFA, leaked password protection)
- Deploy to production (Vercel + Railway)
- Configure WebRTC STUN/TURN servers

### Design Constraints for Development
- All UI components already designed and specified in DESIGN.md
- Use existing design tokens and component library
- Follow established patterns for consistency
- Mobile responsive design already defined

## Technical Decisions
<!-- Important technical decisions made during this cycle -->
### Architecture Decisions
- No new features until PRs are resolved
- Focus on production deployment over development
- Use Vercel for frontend, Railway for WebSocket
- Implement Cloudflare CDN for performance
- Monthly infrastructure cost: ~$125

### Frontend Framework Recommendations
- Continue using Next.js 15 with App Router
- Tailwind CSS + Radix UI for components
- Framer Motion for animations
- Fabric.js with WebGL acceleration for canvas
- Socket.io for real-time collaboration

### Security Requirements
- Enable TOTP + SMS authentication
- Enable leaked password protection
- Configure rate limiting
- Review all RLS policies

## Known Issues
<!-- Issues discovered but not yet resolved -->
### Test Failures
- 13 failing tests (2.5% of total)
- Mainly in template and mobile test suites
- Non-critical, don't block core functionality

### Security Warnings
- Supabase MFA insufficient (only 1 factor)
- Leaked password protection disabled
- No rate limiting configured

## Next Steps
<!-- Clear action items for the next agent/cycle -->
### For Design Phase
- No design work needed - project is feature-complete
- Focus should shift to implementation of deployment plan

### Immediate Actions (Day 1)
1. Start reviewing PR #60 (Priority 3 Features)
2. Test video chat, templates, mobile features
3. Document conflicts with other PRs
4. Create merge strategy for all 13 PRs
