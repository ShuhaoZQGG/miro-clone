## Current State
- Cycle Number: 30
- Branch: cycle-30-âœ…-completed-20250830-131121
- Phase: development

## Completed Work
<!-- Updated by each agent as they complete their phase -->
- **Planning**: Created architectural plan and requirements
### Planning Phase (Completed)
- Analyzed current state: 95.1% test pass rate, core features implemented
- Identified remaining work: collaboration features and production readiness
- Created comprehensive architectural plan for real-time collaboration
- Defined WebSocket integration strategy with Socket.io
- Planned Operation Transformation (OT) for conflict resolution
- Outlined cloud backend architecture with PostgreSQL + Redis
- Specified 4-phase implementation approach

### Design Phase (Completed)
- Created comprehensive UI/UX specifications for collaboration features
- Designed user presence indicators and collaborative cursors
- Specified authentication modal and collaboration toolbar
- Defined responsive layouts for desktop, tablet, and mobile
- Established accessibility standards (WCAG 2.1 AA)
- Created animation specifications for smooth interactions
- Defined error states and conflict resolution UI patterns

## Pending Items
<!-- Items that need attention in the next phase or cycle -->
### For Development Phase
- Implement Socket.io server and client integration
- Build user presence tracking system
- Create collaborative cursor components
- Develop authentication system with JWT
- Implement Operation Transformation engine
- Build conflict resolution UI components
- Add real-time status indicators
- Set up PostgreSQL database schema
- Configure Redis for session management

### Technical Constraints from Design
- Use React + TypeScript for consistency with existing codebase
- Implement Material-UI components for rapid development
- Use Tailwind CSS for responsive design utilities
- Ensure 60fps performance during collaboration
- Support offline-first architecture with IndexedDB
- Use Web Workers for OT calculations to prevent UI blocking

## Technical Decisions
<!-- Important technical decisions made during this cycle -->
### Architecture Choices
- **Real-time**: Socket.io for WebSocket management
- **State Management**: Redux Toolkit + RTK Query for predictable state
- **Backend**: Node.js + Express for API server
- **Database**: PostgreSQL for persistence, Redis for sessions
- **Deployment**: Vercel/AWS for scalability
- **Monitoring**: Sentry for errors, Datadog for metrics

### Collaboration Strategy
- Operation Transformation (OT) for conflict resolution
- Optimistic UI updates for responsiveness
- Viewport-based updates for performance
- Offline queue with retry logic

## Known Issues
<!-- Issues discovered but not yet resolved -->
- No existing backend infrastructure
- Authentication system not implemented
- WebSocket server not set up
- Database schema not defined
- Deployment pipeline not configured

## Next Steps
<!-- Clear action items for the next agent/cycle -->
### Immediate Actions for Development
1. Set up Socket.io server in /server directory
2. Implement WebSocket client connection logic
3. Create cursor tracking system
4. Build operation broadcast mechanism
5. Test multi-client synchronization

### Future Phases
- Design phase: Create UI mockups for collaboration features
- Implementation: Build real-time sync engine
- Testing: Multi-user collaboration scenarios
- Deployment: Production infrastructure setup
