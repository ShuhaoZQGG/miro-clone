## Current State
- Cycle Number: 31
- Branch: cycle-31-âœ…-implemented-20250830-133627
- Phase: development (completed)

## Completed Work
<!-- Updated by each agent as they complete their phase -->

### Development Phase (Attempt 2)
1. **WebSocket Integration with Canvas**
   - Integrated useWebSocket hook with Whiteboard component
   - Connected real-time cursor broadcasting
   - Implemented operation synchronization for element creation/updates
   - Added user presence tracking

2. **Authentication System**
   - Created AuthContext for user management
   - Implemented AuthModal component for login/signup
   - Integrated authentication with WebSocket connection
   - Added local storage persistence for sessions

3. **Database Infrastructure**
   - Created PostgreSQL schema with all required tables
   - Set up Docker Compose for local development
   - Implemented database configuration module
   - Created mock database client for development
   - Added environment variables template

4. **Collaboration UI Components**
   - Enhanced CollaborationPanel to display real-time users
   - Created CollaborationToolbar with sharing features
   - Added connection status indicators
   - Implemented user avatars with colors

## Pending Items
<!-- Items that need attention in the next phase or cycle -->

1. **Production Database Setup**
   - Implement actual PostgreSQL client (using pg library)
   - Implement actual Redis client (using ioredis)
   - Set up connection pooling
   - Implement proper error handling

2. **Authentication Improvements**
   - Implement JWT token generation
   - Add password hashing (bcrypt)
   - Create API endpoints for auth
   - Add OAuth providers (Google, GitHub)

3. **Test Improvements**
   - Fix remaining 48 failing tests (mostly timeout issues)
   - Add integration tests for collaboration features
   - Add E2E tests for authentication flow

4. **Performance Optimization**
   - Implement viewport-based rendering for cursors
   - Add operation batching for better performance
   - Optimize WebSocket message frequency

## Technical Decisions
<!-- Important technical decisions made during this cycle -->

1. **Authentication Strategy**
   - Chose local storage for MVP session persistence
   - Implemented context-based auth state management
   - Used temporary user IDs for guests

2. **Database Architecture**
   - Designed normalized schema with proper relationships
   - Used JSONB for flexible element data storage
   - Implemented operation history for conflict resolution

3. **Collaboration Approach**
   - Real-time cursor broadcasting via WebSocket
   - Operation-based synchronization for canvas changes
   - User presence with heartbeat mechanism

## Known Issues
<!-- Issues discovered but not yet resolved -->

1. **Test Failures**
   - 48 tests failing (14% failure rate)
   - Mostly timeout issues in canvas-engine tests
   - Mock Fabric.js objects causing issues

2. **WebSocket Server**
   - Server implementation exists but not running
   - Need to start server separately on port 3001
   - No reconnection logic in production

3. **Database Connection**
   - Currently using mock database client
   - No actual database connections established
   - Need to install pg and ioredis packages

## Next Steps
<!-- Clear action items for the next agent/cycle -->

1. **Immediate Priorities**
   - Start WebSocket server and test real-time features
   - Install and configure actual database clients
   - Fix critical test failures

2. **Integration Tasks**
   - Connect authentication API endpoints
   - Implement actual database operations
   - Test end-to-end collaboration flow

3. **Production Readiness**
   - Add error boundaries and fallbacks
   - Implement proper logging
   - Set up monitoring and analytics
   - Deploy to staging environment
