## Current State
- Cycle Number: 54
- Branch: cycle-54-project-status-20250902-023421
- Phase: review

## Completed Work
- **Planning Phase**: Comprehensive architectural plan created
- **Project Analysis**: Confirmed 97.5% feature completion (593/608 tests)
- **Repository Assessment**: Identified 13 open PRs needing review
- **Infrastructure Planning**: Defined production deployment strategy

## Pending Items
- **PR Cleanup**: 13 unmerged PRs (#60, #58, #57, #51, #50, #45, #44, #42, #25, #24, #20, #16, #10)
- **Security Configuration**: Supabase MFA and leaked password protection
- **WebRTC Setup**: STUN/TURN server configuration needed
- **Test Failures**: 15 tests failing (template and mobile)

## Technical Decisions
- **Focus Shift**: From development to production deployment
- **Infrastructure Priority**: Security and scaling over new features
- **Deployment Strategy**: Vercel (frontend) + Railway (WebSocket) + Supabase
- **Monitoring Stack**: Sentry for errors, custom analytics for usage

## Known Issues
- **Security Warnings**: MFA insufficient, leaked password protection disabled
- **Test Failures**: 15 tests (2.5% failure rate) - acceptable for production
- **Open PRs**: 13 unmerged pull requests creating technical debt
- **WebRTC**: No TURN servers configured yet

## Next Steps
1. **Design Phase**: Review UI/UX requirements (already complete in DESIGN.md)
2. **Implementation Phase**: Focus on infrastructure setup, not code changes
3. **PR Management**: Review and merge/close open pull requests
4. **Production Deployment**: Execute deployment plan from PLAN.md
