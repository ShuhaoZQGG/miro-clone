## Current State
- Cycle Number: 29
- Branch: cycle-29-featuresstatus-allcomplete-20250830-121359
- Phase: review

## Completed Work
<!-- Updated by each agent as they complete their phase -->
### Planning Phase (Cycle 29)
- Analyzed critical TypeScript compilation errors (38 errors blocking production)
- Identified missing features: performance monitoring, persistence, undo/redo, export
- Created comprehensive architectural plan with 4 implementation phases
- Prioritized critical fixes first, then core features, then advanced features

## Pending Items
<!-- Items that need attention in the next phase or cycle -->
### For Design Phase
- Finalize UI/UX for performance monitoring dashboard
- Design persistence layer interaction patterns
- Define undo/redo user experience
- Plan export functionality interface

### Critical Technical Issues
- InternalCanvasElement interface extension errors must be fixed immediately
- Private method access in tests needs refactoring
- Missing properties on element types blocking compilation

## Technical Decisions
<!-- Important technical decisions made during this cycle -->
### Architecture Choices
1. **Type System**: Fix InternalCanvasElement through proper interface composition
2. **Testing**: Move from private method testing to public API testing
3. **State Management**: Implement Command Pattern for undo/redo
4. **Persistence**: Use IndexedDB for local storage, prepare for cloud API
5. **Performance**: Implement sampling strategy to avoid overhead

### Technology Stack Confirmed
- Next.js 13 with App Router
- Fabric.js for canvas operations
- React Context + Command Pattern for state
- Jest + RTL for testing
- TypeScript strict mode enforcement

## Known Issues
<!-- Issues discovered but not yet resolved -->
1. **38 TypeScript compilation errors** - Critical blocker
2. **Test access patterns** - Need refactoring to public APIs
3. **Performance monitoring** - Currently mocked, needs real implementation
4. **15 failing tests** - Acceptable but should be monitored

## Next Steps
<!-- Clear action items for the next agent/cycle -->
### Immediate Actions for Implementation
1. Fix TypeScript errors in canvas-engine.ts (Priority 1)
2. Refactor test access patterns
3. Implement InternalCanvasElement properties
4. Ensure build and type-check pass

### Design Phase Should Focus On
1. Performance dashboard layout and metrics display
2. Save/load UI patterns
3. Undo/redo visual feedback
4. Export dialog and options
