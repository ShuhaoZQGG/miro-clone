## Completed Work
### Test Fixes (Development Phase - Attempt 3)
- **Development**: Implemented features with TDD (attempt 3)
- ✅ Fixed fabric.Image.fromURL mock in element creation tests
- ✅ Added AuthProvider wrapper to canvas disposal tests  
- ✅ Resolved role selector conflicts in whiteboard integration tests
- ✅ Achieved 100% test pass rate (311/311 tests passing)

- ✅ Created PR #30 for production deployment

## Pending Items
- PR #30 needs review and merge
- Production deployment to Vercel
- WebSocket server deployment to Railway/Render
- Configure production environment variables
- Security audit
- Performance load testing

## Technical Decisions
### Test Infrastructure
- Used mock implementations for fabric.Image.fromURL to handle test environment limitations
- Wrapped all React components with AuthProvider in tests to prevent context errors
- Replaced generic role selectors with class-based selectors to avoid conflicts

### Production Readiness
- All database configuration scripts ready
- Migration scripts include backup and rollback procedures
- Security middleware fully implemented (rate limiting, CORS, headers)
- Environment templates provided for easy deployment

## Known Issues
- None - all tests passing, build successful

## Next Steps
1. **Review Phase**: Review PR #30 for production deployment
2. **Deployment**: 
   - Deploy frontend to Vercel
   - Deploy WebSocket server to Railway/Render
   - Configure production databases (PostgreSQL + Redis)
3. **Testing**:
   - Run security audit
   - Perform load testing
   - Monitor initial deployment metrics
