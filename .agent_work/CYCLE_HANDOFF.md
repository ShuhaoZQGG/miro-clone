## Current State
- Cycle Number: 25
- Branch: cycle-25-featuresstatus-partialcomplete-20250830-093034
- Phase: design

## Completed Work
<!-- Updated by each agent as they complete their phase -->
- **Design**: Created UI/UX specifications and mockups
- Design phase completed with UI/UX specifications focused on developer experience
- Created comprehensive test dashboard mockups for real-time test monitoring
- Designed performance overlay with FPS, memory, and RAF metrics
- Added element inspector panel for debugging canvas interactions

## Pending Items
<!-- Items that need attention in the next phase or cycle -->
- TypeScript build error at canvas-engine.ts:910 needs immediate fix
- 59 failing tests require stabilization (target: <10 failures)
- RAF mock implementation needs comprehensive solution
- Performance overlay CPU usage must stay under 1%

## Technical Decisions
<!-- Important technical decisions made during this cycle -->
- Frontend Framework: Continue with existing Next.js 14 + TypeScript stack
- Testing UI: React-based dashboard for real-time test monitoring
- Performance Monitoring: Web Performance API with custom metrics
- Debug Tools: Browser DevTools integration with custom formatters

## Known Issues
<!-- Issues discovered but not yet resolved -->
- Property 'data' does not exist on type 'CanvasElement' (blocking build)
- RAF timing issues causing test failures
- Canvas-fullscreen test failures
- Smooth-interactions test issues

## Next Steps
<!-- Clear action items for the next agent/cycle -->
1. Fix critical TypeScript build error first
2. Implement test dashboard with real-time updates
3. Add basic FPS overlay (draggable, semi-transparent)
4. Stabilize RAF mock for consistent test timing
5. Reduce test failures to under 10
