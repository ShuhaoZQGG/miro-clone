## Summary

Planning phase for Cycle 41 completed successfully:

### ✅ Completed Tasks
1. **Fixed TypeScript Build Error**: Removed invalid 'staging' case from sentry-production.config.ts
2. **Created Comprehensive PLAN.md**: Detailed plan for remaining features and production deployment
3. **Analyzed Project State**: Identified missing dependencies and build blockers
4. **Pushed to Branch**: cycle-41-✅-implemented-20250830-193749

### 📋 Key Decisions Made
- Use CRDT for conflict resolution instead of OT
- Implement WebGL rendering for performance
- Choose Sentry over DataDog (free tier sufficient)
- Deploy WebSocket to Railway (better than Render)
- Keep monorepo structure for simplicity

### 🚧 Critical Issues Identified
1. **@sentry/nextjs** dependency not installed
2. **/api/health** route missing
3. TypeScript errors in test files
4. Build currently failing

### 📍 Next Phase Requirements
The design phase should focus on conflict resolution UX, while implementation must first fix build errors by installing Sentry and creating the health check route.
