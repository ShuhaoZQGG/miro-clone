The project-architect agent has analyzed your Miro clone vision and created a comprehensive project plan. The complete PLAN.md file has been created in your project directory with detailed coverage of:

- **Requirements Analysis**: MVP features, user personas, and prioritization framework
- **System Architecture**: Real-time collaboration design with operational transforms
- **Technology Stack**: Next.js + Fabric.js frontend, Node.js backend, PostgreSQL/Redis storage
- **Project Phases**: 5 phases over 8 months with 20 sprints and clear deliverables
- **Risk Assessment**: Technical, performance, and business risks with mitigation strategies

The plan provides a practical roadmap for building a production-ready collaborative whiteboard platform, starting with core drawing tools and progressing to advanced features like templates, integrations, and enterprise capabilities.
