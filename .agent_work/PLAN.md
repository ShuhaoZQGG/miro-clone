## Planning Phase Complete

Successfully created comprehensive architectural plan for Cycle 20:

### Key Decisions Made:
- **Focus**: Fix canvas full-screen and smoothness issues from Cycle 19
- **Priority**: Resolve 28 TypeScript errors and 66 failing tests first
- **Approach**: Four-phase implementation (critical fixes → full-screen → smoothness → testing)
- **Performance Targets**: 60fps rendering, <10ms response time

### Files Updated:
- `PLAN.md`: Complete architectural plan with requirements, phases, risks, and metrics
- `CYCLE_HANDOFF.md`: Planning phase completion details and next steps

### Branch Status:
- Created: `cycle-20-featuresstatus-allcomplete-20250830-074943`
- Committed: "feat(cycle-20): update architectural planning"
- Pushed to remote (ready for PR creation)

The planning phase is complete. Design phase can now proceed with creating UI/UX designs for the full-screen canvas and smooth interactions.
