The project-architect agent has analyzed your Miro clone project and created a comprehensive plan. The complete **PLAN.md** file has been generated at `/Users/shuhaozhang/Project/miro-clone/PLAN.md`.

**Key Highlights:**

ðŸ”´ **Critical Finding**: 26 TypeScript errors and 46 failed tests are blocking all progress

ðŸ“‹ **4-Phase Approach (16 weeks total)**:
- **Phase 1 (Weeks 1-3)**: Fix all existing issues first
- **Phase 2 (Weeks 4-7)**: Complete core features  
- **Phase 3 (Weeks 8-12)**: Advanced features
- **Phase 4 (Weeks 13-16)**: Production readiness

ðŸš¨ **Immediate Priority**: NO new features until existing technical debt is resolved

The plan emphasizes addressing the REVIEW.md feedback first, then building upon the solid architectural foundation already established. Would you like me to begin implementing Phase 1 to fix the critical issues?
