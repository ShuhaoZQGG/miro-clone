## Summary

Planning phase for Cycle 16 completed successfully. I've created a comprehensive plan to address the critical issues:

### Key Issues Identified:
1. **2 failing E2E tests** - preventing validation of canvas disposal fix
2. **Canvas refresh loop** - causing continuous re-renders and DOM disposal errors
3. **Viewport metadata warning** - incorrect export location in Next.js

### Architectural Decisions Made:
- **Canvas Lifecycle:** Implement ref tracking to prevent refresh loops
- **E2E Testing:** Use debug mode with verbose logging
- **DOM Safety:** Enhanced parent-child verification before removal
- **Performance:** Target 60fps with zero disposal errors

### Implementation Plan (6 hours total):
- **Phase 1 (2h):** Fix viewport metadata and debug E2E tests
- **Phase 2 (3h):** Resolve canvas refresh loop with stable cleanup
- **Phase 3 (1h):** Comprehensive testing and validation

### Deliverables:
- PLAN.md updated with comprehensive technical approach
- CYCLE_HANDOFF.md updated with planning phase completion
- Branch created and pushed: `cycle-16-fix-e2e-and-canvas-refresh-20250830`

The plan focuses on stability and ensuring the canvas works without refresh loops while achieving 100% E2E test pass rate.
