The planning phase is complete. Let me create a summary of what was accomplished:

## Summary

Successfully completed the planning phase for Cycle 11 with a comprehensive plan to address the critical canvas disposal error and implement E2E testing.

### Key Deliverables:
1. **Updated PLAN.md** with:
   - 4-phase implementation approach (13 hours total)
   - Clear focus on fixing canvas disposal error at src/lib/canvas-engine.ts:617
   - Strategy for resolving 24 ESLint errors blocking the build
   - E2E test execution and validation plan
   - Performance targets (disposal < 50ms)

2. **Updated CYCLE_HANDOFF.md** with:
   - Planning phase completion status
   - Key architectural decisions
   - Technical context for next phase

3. **Git Tasks Completed**:
   - Created new branch: cycle-11-5-comprehensive-20250830-010031
   - Committed planning documents with message: "feat(cycle-11): update architectural planning"
   - Pushed to remote (new PR can be created at the provided URL)

### Next Steps for Design Phase:
- No design phase needed - continuing with existing designs from Cycle 9
- Proceed directly to development phase to fix ESLint errors and canvas disposal issue

The plan focuses on fixing the immediate issues (canvas disposal error and build failures) before establishing comprehensive E2E testing to prevent similar problems in the future.
