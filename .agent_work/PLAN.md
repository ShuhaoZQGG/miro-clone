## Summary

Planning phase completed successfully. Created comprehensive architectural plan for Cycle 22 focusing on:

1. **Test Stability** - Fix 64 failing tests (Priority 1)
2. **E2E Testing** - Add full-screen and performance tests
3. **Performance Monitoring** - FPS counter and metrics dashboard
4. **Code Quality** - ESLint and TypeScript improvements

Key decisions:
- Quality over features this cycle
- 4-phase implementation (5 days total)
- Maintain existing tech stack
- Focus on achieving 100% test pass rate

Committed to branch `cycle-22-next-improvements` and pushed. Ready for design phase.
