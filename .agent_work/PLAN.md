## Planning Phase Complete

I've successfully completed the planning phase for Cycle 30. Here's what was accomplished:

### Completed:
1. **Analyzed** the current state - Previous cycles achieved 95.1% test pass rate and implemented core features
2. **Created** comprehensive project plan focusing on:
   - Real-time collaboration with Socket.io
   - Operation Transformation for conflict resolution
   - Cloud backend with PostgreSQL + Redis
   - Production deployment strategy
3. **Updated** CYCLE_HANDOFF.md with architectural decisions and pending questions
4. **Committed** changes with message: `feat(cycle-30): update architectural planning for collaboration features`
5. **Pushed** to new branch: `cycle-30-collaboration-features-20250830-131055`

### Key Architectural Decisions:
- **Real-time**: Socket.io for WebSocket management
- **Conflict Resolution**: Operation Transformation (OT)
- **Backend**: Node.js + Express + PostgreSQL + Redis
- **Deployment**: Vercel/AWS for scalability

### Next Phase (Design):
The design phase should focus on:
- User presence UI/UX specifications
- Collaborative cursor visual design
- Authentication flow wireframes
- Real-time sync status indicators

The plan is now ready in PLAN.md for the next development phase.
