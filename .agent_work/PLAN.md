## Summary

I've successfully completed the planning phase for Cycle 29. Here's what was accomplished:

### ‚úÖ Completed Tasks

1. **Analyzed Current State**: Reviewed DESIGN.md, IMPLEMENTATION.md, REVIEW.md, and NEXT_CYCLE_TASKS.md to understand the project status
2. **Identified Critical Issues**: Found 38 TypeScript compilation errors blocking production deployment
3. **Created Comprehensive Plan**: Developed a detailed architectural plan in PLAN.md with:
   - Clear prioritization of fixes and features
   - 4-phase implementation approach
   - Risk mitigation strategies
   - Success criteria and deliverables

### üìã Key Planning Decisions

**Priority 1: Critical Fixes**
- Fix InternalCanvasElement interface issues
- Resolve test access pattern violations  
- Ensure TypeScript compilation passes

**Priority 2: Core Features**
- Real performance monitoring dashboard
- Persistence layer (save/load)
- Undo/redo system
- Export functionality

**Priority 3: Advanced Features**
- WebSocket collaboration
- Real-time cursors
- Conflict resolution

### üèóÔ∏è Technical Architecture
- **Type System**: Proper interface composition for InternalCanvasElement
- **Testing**: Move from private method testing to public API testing
- **State**: Command Pattern for undo/redo
- **Persistence**: IndexedDB + API preparation

### üìù Handoff Notes
Updated CYCLE_HANDOFF.md with completed work and clear next steps for the design and implementation phases.

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Note
The git push failed due to SSH connectivity issues, but the changes are committed locally on branch `cycle-29-featuresstatus-allcomplete-20250830-121402`. The PR will need to be created once connectivity is restored.
