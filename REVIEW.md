# Cycle 35 Review

## Summary
Cycle 35 attempted to implement WebSocket collaboration features as the foundation for real-time multi-user editing. While significant progress was made, critical issues prevent approval.

## Code Quality Assessment

### Strengths
- Tests achieve 100% pass rate (346/348 passing, 2 skipped)
- WebSocket infrastructure properly architected with Socket.io
- Good separation of concerns (server/client/UI)
- Cursor tracking throttled appropriately (20Hz)
- Reconnection logic with exponential backoff

### Critical Issues

#### 1. Build Failure (BLOCKING)
- TypeScript compilation error in `websocket-client.ts:81`
- Type mismatch: `Collaborator` vs `UserPresence` interfaces
- Build cannot complete, preventing deployment

#### 2. Architecture Concerns
- No authentication on WebSocket connections (security risk)
- Missing JWT verification in WebSocket handshake
- No rate limiting on WebSocket events
- Cursor positions not transformed for different screen sizes

#### 3. Missing Core Features
- No backend API endpoints for board persistence
- No database integration (PostgreSQL/Redis)
- No conflict resolution (OT/CRDT)
- No cloud storage integration

## Security Assessment
- Environment variables properly isolated in test files
- No hardcoded secrets found
- However, WebSocket server lacks authentication middleware

## Test Coverage
- Unit tests comprehensive
- Integration tests passing
- Missing E2E tests for collaboration features
- No load testing for WebSocket server

## Recommendation
The cycle cannot be approved due to the build failure. While the WebSocket foundation is solid, the TypeScript error must be fixed before merging. Additionally, the lack of authentication on WebSocket connections poses a security risk.

<!-- CYCLE_DECISION: NEEDS_REVISION -->
<!-- ARCHITECTURE_NEEDED: NO -->
<!-- DESIGN_NEEDED: NO -->
<!-- BREAKING_CHANGES: NO -->

## Required Changes
1. Fix TypeScript compilation error (Collaborator/UserPresence type mismatch)
2. Add JWT authentication to WebSocket handshake
3. Implement rate limiting on WebSocket events
4. Add E2E tests for collaboration features

## Next Cycle Priorities
1. Fix the blocking build error
2. Add authentication layer to WebSocket
3. Implement backend API for persistence
4. Setup PostgreSQL and Redis
5. Add operation transformation for conflict resolution
