zoomTo(zoom: number): void
zoomToPoint(point: Position, zoom: number): void

// Performance optimization
cullElements(elements: CanvasElement[]): CanvasElement[]
throttledRender(): void
```

- ✅ **Collaboration Ready:** User presence and real-time state structure
- ✅ **Helper Functions:** Selectors and action helpers for easy consumption

**State Structure:**
```typescript
interface CanvasState {
  elements: CanvasElement[]         // Canvas content
  selectedElementIds: string[]     // Selection tracking
  camera: Camera                   // Viewport state
  tool: Tool                      // Current tool
  collaborators: Map<UserPresence> // Real-time users
}
```

### 4. Component Architecture ✅ WELL-DESIGNED

**Key Components Reviewed:**
- `Whiteboard.tsx` - Main canvas container with proper event handling
