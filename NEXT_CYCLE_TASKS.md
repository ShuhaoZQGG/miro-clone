   - [ ] Test real-time features in production
   
2. **Environment Configuration**
   - [ ] Set JWT_SECRET environment variable
   - [ ] Configure DATABASE_URL for PostgreSQL
   - [ ] Set up REDIS_URL for production Redis
   - [ ] Add CORS configuration

### Priority 1: Database Connection
1. **PostgreSQL Production Setup**

   - [ ] Test database operations
   - [ ] Implement connection pooling

2. **Redis Production Setup**
   - [ ] Set up production Redis instance
   - [ ] Configure pub/sub for real-time events
   - [ ] Test session persistence

### Priority 2: Test Stabilization
1. **Fix Failing Tests**
   - [ ] Resolve canvas-engine timeout issues (48 tests failing)
   - [ ] Fix Fabric.js mock problems
   - [ ] Improve test isolation
   - [ ] Target >95% pass rate

### Priority 3: Security & Performance
1. **Security Hardening**
   - [ ] Add rate limiting to API endpoints
   - [ ] Implement CORS properly for production
   - [ ] Add input sanitization
   - [ ] Set up security headers

2. **Performance Optimization**
   - [ ] Optimize WebSocket message batching
   - [ ] Implement connection pooling
   - [ ] Add caching strategies
   - [ ] Monitor performance metrics

### Priority 4: Critical Bug Fixes
1. **Canvas Engine Test Failures**
   - [ ] Fix 48 failing tests in canvas-engine.test.ts
   - [ ] Resolve timeout issues with Fabric.js mocks
   - [ ] Improve test isolation and stability
   - [ ] Target 95% test pass rate

## Priority 5: UI/UX Improvements
1. **Frontend-Backend Integration**
   - [ ] Connect React components to WebSocket server
   - [ ] Implement real-time cursor tracking UI
   - [ ] Add collaborative editing features
   - [ ] Build user presence indicators
   - [ ] Test real-time synchronization

2. **Mobile Optimization**
   - Responsive design for tablets
   - Touch gesture support
   - Mobile-friendly controls
   - Viewport optimization

## Technical Debt
1. **Test Stabilization**
   - Fix 48 failing canvas-engine tests (timeout issues)
   - Improve test isolation
   - Add E2E tests for collaboration
   - Increase coverage to 95%

2. **Performance Optimization**
   - Implement Web Workers for OT calculations
   - Add connection pooling
   - Optimize bundle size
   - Implement lazy loading

3. **Security Hardening**
   - Add rate limiting
   - Implement input validation
   - Add CSRF protection
   - Set up security headers

## Documentation Needs
1. WebSocket API documentation
2. Deployment guide for production
3. User guide for collaboration features
4. Architecture documentation updates

## Future Enhancements
1. **Advanced Features**
   - Version history with time travel
