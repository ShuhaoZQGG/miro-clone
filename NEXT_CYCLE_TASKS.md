# Next Cycle Tasks - CRITICAL PRIORITY

## ⚠️ STOP: No New Features Until PR Crisis Resolved

### Phase 1: Security First (IMMEDIATE)
- [ ] Merge PR #24 - JWT security vulnerability fixes
- [ ] Merge PR #25 - Production security hardening  
- [ ] Verify Supabase RLS policies are active
- [ ] Enable leaked password protection in Supabase Auth
- [ ] Configure MFA options for enhanced security

### Phase 2: Architecture Decision (CRITICAL)
**Must choose ONE WebGL implementation:**
- [ ] Review PR #57 (Three.js WebGL) vs PR #58 (Native WebGL)
- [ ] Make final decision on WebGL approach
- [ ] Document decision rationale
- [ ] Close the rejected PR

### Phase 3: Feature Integration
- [ ] Merge PR #45 - Core auth, comments, PDF export
- [ ] Merge PR #51 - UI integration for core features
- [ ] Resolve conflicts in PR #60 - Video chat, templates, mobile
- [ ] Test integrated features on main branch

### Phase 4: Cleanup
- [ ] Close superseded PRs (#10, #16, #20, #42, #44)
- [ ] Update all documentation to reflect merged state
- [ ] Run full test suite and fix any failures
- [ ] Create comprehensive integration test

## Technical Debt Items

### Code Quality
- [ ] Fix 13 failing tests in mobile-manager and webgl-renderer
- [ ] Remove duplicate CRDT implementations
- [ ] Consolidate conflicting mobile handlers
- [ ] Update TypeScript types for merged features

### Documentation
- [ ] Update README.md with all merged features
- [ ] Create architecture decision record (ADR) for WebGL choice
- [ ] Document PR management policy
- [ ] Update API documentation

### Process Improvements
- [ ] Implement 3-PR maximum policy
- [ ] Set up automated PR conflict detection
- [ ] Create merge checklist template
- [ ] Establish code ownership map

## DO NOT PROCEED WITH:
- ❌ New feature development
- ❌ Creating new PRs
- ❌ Starting new cycles
- ❌ Any work not related to PR consolidation

## Success Criteria
- All 13 PRs resolved (merged or closed)
- Zero security vulnerabilities
- Single WebGL implementation chosen
- All tests passing (100%)
- Clean main branch with no conflicts

**Priority Level: ARCHITECTURAL INTERVENTION REQUIRED**

The next cycle MUST focus exclusively on consolidating the 13 open PRs. No progress is possible until this technical debt is resolved.
