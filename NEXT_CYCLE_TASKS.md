# Next Cycle Tasks

## Critical - TypeScript Compilation Fixes (Priority 1)
1. **Fix InternalCanvasElement Interface Issues**
   - Resolve interface extension errors (line 29 in canvas-engine.ts)
   - Ensure proper type compatibility between InternalCanvasElement and CanvasElement
   - Fix missing property definitions (id, position, size, fabricObject)

2. **Fix Test Access Patterns**
   - Replace private method access with proper testing patterns
   - Use public APIs or test-specific exposure patterns
   - Fix issues in:
     - canvas-fullscreen.test.tsx (handleResize, setViewportSize, setupSmoothRendering)
     - canvas-engine.test.ts (handleResize)

3. **Fix Type Safety Issues**
   - Resolve globalThis index signature issues in smooth-interactions.test.ts
   - Fix type 'never' call signature in canvas-disposal.test.tsx
   - Address 'any' type assignments in integration tests

## High Priority - Code Quality
1. **ESLint Warnings**
   - Replace 7 instances of 'any' types with proper types
   - Located primarily in src/types/index.ts

2. **Test Stability**
   - Monitor and fix remaining 15 failing tests if they become critical
   - Focus on timing-sensitive tests that may fail in CI/CD

## Medium Priority - Technical Debt
1. **Test Infrastructure**
   - Consider migrating from jsdom to a more complete DOM environment for CSS tests
   - Improve timer mock utilities for more predictable test execution

2. **Documentation**
   - Document the test mocking strategy for future developers
   - Add comments explaining InternalCanvasElement usage pattern

## Low Priority - Future Enhancements
1. **Performance Monitoring**
   - Implement actual performance dashboard (currently mocked)
   - Add real-time metrics collection

2. **E2E Testing**
   - Add Playwright or Cypress tests for critical user flows
   - Test actual canvas interactions in a real browser

## Notes for Next Developer
- The cycle achieved 95.1% test pass rate successfully
- TypeScript compilation errors are the only blocker for merge
- Focus on fixing type issues without breaking the working tests
- The test infrastructure improvements are solid and should be preserved
