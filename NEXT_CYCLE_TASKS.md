- [ ] Improve RAF mock setup for animation tests
- [ ] Adjust unrealistic timing expectations in tests
- [ ] Fix mock setup for async operations
- [ ] Resolve timeout issues in performance benchmarks

#### 2. E2E Testing
- [ ] Add E2E tests for full-screen canvas behavior
- [ ] Test canvas resize responsiveness
- [ ] Verify 60fps performance in E2E scenarios
- [ ] Test GPU acceleration effectiveness

#### 3. Performance Monitoring
- [ ] Implement performance monitoring dashboard
- [ ] Add FPS counter component (dev mode)
- [ ] Create performance metrics collection
- [ ] Add memory usage tracking

#### 4. Code Quality (Low Priority)
- [ ] Address ESLint 'any' type warnings
- [ ] Improve type safety in utility functions
- [ ] Add stricter TypeScript configurations

## Completed in Cycle 20 âœ…

### Critical Fixes (All Completed)
- [x] Implemented `setupSmoothRendering()` method in `canvas-engine.ts`
- [x] Fixed all 28 TypeScript compilation errors
- [x] Installed `lucide-react` package
- [x] Created `@/lib/utils` module with cn, debounce, throttle
- [x] Fixed undefined variables in tests
- [x] Resolved all ESLint errors (warnings remain)

### Technical Debt from Previous Cycles

#### Performance Enhancements
- [ ] Consider implementing WebGL renderer for very large canvases
- [ ] Add worker threads for heavy computations
- [ ] Implement progressive rendering for complex scenes
- [ ] Add virtual scrolling for canvases with 1000+ elements

#### Testing Improvements
- [ ] Add integration tests for full screen feature
- [ ] Create performance benchmarks documentation
- [ ] Add more edge case tests for canvas interactions
- [ ] Implement automated performance regression tests

#### Documentation
- [ ] Document performance optimization strategies
- [ ] Create troubleshooting guide for canvas issues
- [ ] Add API documentation for new canvas methods
- [ ] Update README with new features from Cycle 19

### Feature Enhancements (Lower Priority)

#### Canvas Features
- [ ] Add canvas grid snapping option
- [ ] Implement canvas minimap for large boards
- [ ] Add canvas zoom presets (fit, 100%, 200%, etc.)
- [ ] Implement canvas rulers and guides

#### Collaboration Features
- [ ] Add real-time cursor tracking
- [ ] Implement collaborative selection
- [ ] Add user presence indicators
- [ ] Create conflict resolution for concurrent edits

### Infrastructure Improvements

#### CI/CD
- [ ] Set up automated type checking in CI
- [ ] Add ESLint checks to PR validation
- [ ] Implement automated performance testing
- [ ] Create deployment preview environments

#### Code Quality
- [ ] Set up pre-commit hooks for linting
- [ ] Implement code coverage requirements
- [ ] Add automated dependency updates
- [ ] Create coding standards documentation

## Priority Order

1. **Immediate (Blocking PR #10)**
   - Fix TypeScript compilation errors
   - Fix failing unit tests
   - Install missing dependencies
   - Clean up ESLint errors

2. **High (Next Sprint)**
   - Performance enhancements
   - Testing improvements
   - Critical documentation

3. **Medium (Future Sprints)**
   - Canvas feature enhancements
   - Collaboration features
   - Infrastructure improvements

4. **Low (Backlog)**
   - Nice-to-have features
   - Non-critical optimizations
   - Extended documentation

## Success Criteria for Next Cycle
- [ ] All TypeScript errors resolved (0 errors)
- [ ] All unit tests passing (100% pass rate)
- [ ] All dependencies installed and resolving
- [ ] ESLint errors cleaned up
- [ ] PR #10 approved and merged
- [ ] New branch created for Cycle 20
