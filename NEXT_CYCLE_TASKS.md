# Next Cycle Tasks

## Critical Priority (Must Fix - Cycle 37)
1. **BUILD FAILURE**: Fix TypeScript error in `/src/app/api/auth/login/route.ts:39`
   - User type missing password property
   - Blocking production build
   
2. **Test Coverage**: Fix remaining 38 test failures to achieve >95% pass rate
   - Canvas engine test timeouts in debounce operations
   - Fabric.js mock interactions not working properly
   - Integration test timing issues
   - Performance test expectations with throttling

## High Priority
1. **WebSocket Server Implementation**
   - Complete Socket.io server setup
   - Client connection management
   - Real-time event broadcasting
   - Reconnection strategies
   - Error handling

2. **Authentication Flow Completion**
   - User registration flow UI
   - Login/logout functionality
   - Session management
   - Protected routes
   - Password reset flow

3. **Real-time Collaboration Features**
   - Cursor position sharing
   - Element operation broadcasting
   - User presence system
   - Conflict resolution (OT/CRDT)
   - Live user avatars

## Medium Priority
1. **Monitoring & Analytics**
   - Sentry error tracking integration
   - Performance monitoring dashboard
   - User analytics
   - Usage metrics
   - Error alerting

2. **Documentation**
   - Complete deployment guide
   - API documentation
   - Developer setup guide
   - Architecture documentation
   - Troubleshooting guide

3. **Cloud Integration**
   - S3 file storage setup
   - Cloud sync implementation
   - Backup strategies
   - CDN configuration
   - Version history

## Low Priority
1. **UI/UX Enhancements**
   - Dark mode support
   - Mobile responsiveness improvements
   - Accessibility (WCAG compliance)
   - Animation polish
   - Keyboard shortcuts

2. **Performance Optimization**
   - Code splitting implementation
   - Lazy loading components
   - Bundle size optimization
   - Image optimization
   - Viewport-based rendering

## Technical Debt
1. Add rate limiting to API endpoints
2. Implement comprehensive input sanitization
3. Add structured logging with log levels
4. Create E2E test suite with Playwright
5. Set up CI/CD pipeline with GitHub Actions
6. Add database migrations system
7. Implement caching strategy

## Known Issues to Address
- Canvas engine debounce test causing timeouts
- Fabric.js mock limitations preventing proper interaction tests
- Missing WebSocket error handling and retry logic
- Incomplete offline support implementation
- Some AuthProvider wrapper issues in tests

## Completed in Cycle 36
- ✅ Fixed critical JWT secret security vulnerability
- ✅ Added environment variable validation
- ✅ Implemented database connection error handling
- ✅ Enhanced production deployment configuration
- ✅ Improved test coverage from 86% to 88%

## Success Metrics for Next Cycle
- [ ] Test coverage >95% (currently 88%)
- [ ] WebSocket server fully functional
- [ ] Authentication working end-to-end
- [ ] Real-time collaboration MVP complete
- [ ] Zero critical security issues
- [ ] Successful production deployment
- [ ] Monitoring and alerting configured
- [ ] Load testing completed (100+ concurrent users)

## Notes
- Security has been addressed but needs ongoing review
- Production configuration is ready but needs testing
- Database resilience implemented but needs stress testing
- Test improvements made but more work needed for stability
