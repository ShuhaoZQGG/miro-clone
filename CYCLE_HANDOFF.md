- **Code Quality:** All TypeScript compilation errors resolved
- **Architecture:** Clean separation of concerns with ElementManager
- **Fabric.js Integration:** All new elements properly render on canvas

### Remaining Work
- **Real-time Collaboration:** WebSocket server not yet implemented
- **Export Functionality:** PNG/PDF/SVG export pending
