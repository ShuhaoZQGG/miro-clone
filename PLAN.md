- **Monitoring Deployment**: Sentry, analytics, uptime monitoring
- **Performance Optimization**: CDN, database indexing, caching

## Security Considerations

### Implemented
- Row-Level Security (RLS) on all tables
- Authentication with JWT tokens
- Session management
- HTTPS enforcement
- Input validation

### Required for Production
- Enable MFA (currently insufficient)
- Leaked password protection
- Rate limiting
- DDoS protection
- Security audit

## Performance Targets

### Achieved
- 60 FPS canvas operations
- 1000+ objects handling
- <100ms tool switching
- <3s initial load

### Optimization Areas
- Mobile gesture performance
- WebRTC bandwidth usage
- Large file uploads
- Template loading speed

## Risk Analysis

### Technical Risks
1. **WebRTC Scaling**: TURN server costs at scale
   - Mitigation: Implement adaptive quality, connection pooling
   
2. **Canvas Performance**: Complex boards with 10K+ objects
   - Mitigation: Enhanced virtualization, progressive rendering

3. **Real-time Sync**: Network latency in global deployment
   - Mitigation: Regional servers, optimistic UI updates

### Business Risks
1. **Infrastructure Costs**: Database, storage, bandwidth
   - Mitigation: Usage-based pricing, caching strategies

2. **Security Vulnerabilities**: Data breaches, unauthorized access
   - Mitigation: Regular audits, penetration testing
