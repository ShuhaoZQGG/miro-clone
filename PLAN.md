## Risk Analysis

### Technical Risks
1. **WebRTC Scaling**: TURN server costs at scale
   - Mitigation: Implement adaptive quality, connection pooling
   
2. **Canvas Performance**: Complex boards with 10K+ objects
   - Mitigation: Enhanced virtualization, progressive rendering

3. **Real-time Sync**: Network latency in global deployment
   - Mitigation: Regional servers, optimistic UI updates

### Business Risks
1. **Infrastructure Costs**: Database, storage, bandwidth
   - Mitigation: Usage-based pricing, caching strategies

2. **Security Vulnerabilities**: Data breaches, unauthorized access
   - Mitigation: Regular audits, penetration testing

## Deployment Strategy

### Environment Setup
```
Development → Staging → Production
├── Feature branches → Main branch
├── Automated testing pipeline
├── Manual QA checkpoint
└── Progressive rollout
```

### CI/CD Pipeline
1. GitHub Actions for automated testing
2. Vercel preview deployments
3. Staging environment validation
4. Production deployment with rollback

## Monitoring & Maintenance

### Metrics

## Resource Allocation

### Human Resources

- 1 DevOps engineer for deployment
- 1 QA engineer for testing

### Financial Resources
- Supabase Pro: $25/month
- Vercel Pro: $20/month
- Railway: ~$10/month
- Cloudflare Pro: $20/month
- TURN Server: ~$50/month
- **Total**: ~$125/month

## Success Criteria

### Week 1 Goals
- 0 open PRs (all resolved)
- All security features enabled
- Test suite 100% passing

### Week 2 Goals
- Production deployment live
- < 3s page load time
- 99.9% uptime achieved
- All monitoring active

## Risk Mitigation

### PR Conflicts
- Risk: Merge conflicts between 13 PRs
- Mitigation: Systematic review, test after each merge

### Deployment Issues
- Risk: Production environment failures
- Mitigation: Staging environment testing first

### Security Vulnerabilities
- Risk: Exposed without MFA/rate limiting
- Mitigation: Enable all security features before launch

## Conclusion

The Miro Clone is feature-complete but blocked by technical debt (13 PRs) and missing production infrastructure. Cycle 55 must focus exclusively on PR consolidation and deployment. No new features should be developed until the application is live in production with all security measures enabled. The 12-day timeline is aggressive but achievable with focused effort on the defined priorities.
