## PR Consolidation Strategy (URGENT)

### Phase 1: Security First (Days 1-2)
1. Merge PR #24 - JWT vulnerability fixes
2. Merge PR #25 - Production security hardening
3. Enable Supabase leaked password protection
4. Configure MFA options (currently insufficient)

### Phase 2: Architecture Decision (Days 3-4)
**Must choose ONE WebGL implementation:**
- **Option A**: PR #57 (Three.js) - Better performance, 40% FPS gain, larger bundle
- **Option B**: PR #58 (Native WebGL) - Smaller footprint, more control
- Close the rejected implementation to avoid conflicts

### Phase 3: Core Feature Integration (Days 5-8)
1. Merge PR #45 - Authentication, Comments, PDF Export
2. Merge PR #51 - UI components integration
3. Resolve conflicts in PR #60 - Video chat, templates, mobile
4. Integrate unified CRDT manager

### Phase 4: Cleanup (Days 9-10)
1. Close superseded PRs (#10, #16, #20, #42, #44)
2. Update all documentation
3. Fix 13 failing tests (mobile-manager, webgl-renderer)
4. Validate production readiness

## Risk Analysis

### Critical Risks (IMMEDIATE)
1. **Technical Debt Crisis**: 13 open PRs with 15,000+ lines unmerged
   - Impact: Development paralysis, increasing conflicts
   - Mitigation: Stop new development, execute consolidation plan
   
2. **Architecture Conflict**: Two incompatible WebGL implementations
   - Impact: Cannot have both PR #57 and #58
   - Mitigation: Make decision within 48 hours

3. **Security Vulnerabilities**: Known issues in PRs #24, #25
   - Impact: JWT vulnerabilities, missing MFA
   - Mitigation: Merge security PRs immediately

### Technical Risks
1. **Merge Conflicts**: Growing daily across 13 PRs
   - Mitigation: Daily merge cycles, clear ownership

2. **Canvas Performance**: Complex boards with 10K+ objects
   - Mitigation: Enhanced virtualization, progressive rendering

3. **Real-time Sync**: Network latency in global deployment
   - Mitigation: Regional servers, optimistic UI updates

### Business Risks
1. **Development Velocity**: Zero progress until consolidation
   - Mitigation: Focus entire team on PR resolution

2. **Quality Degradation**: Untested merged code
   - Mitigation: Comprehensive testing after each merge

## Deployment Strategy

### Environment Setup
```
Development → Staging → Production
├── Feature branches → Main branch
├── Automated testing pipeline
├── Manual QA checkpoint
└── Progressive rollout
```

### CI/CD Pipeline
1. GitHub Actions for automated testing
2. Vercel preview deployments
3. Staging environment validation
4. Production deployment with rollback

## Monitoring & Maintenance

### Metrics
- Application performance (Core Web Vitals)
- Error rates (Sentry)
- User engagement (Analytics)
- Infrastructure health (Uptime)
- Real-time latency (WebSocket/WebRTC)

### Maintenance Plan
- Weekly dependency updates
- Monthly security patches
- Quarterly performance reviews
- Annual architecture assessment

## Database Schema (Supabase)

### Core Tables
```sql
boards (id, title, owner_id, created_at, updated_at)
canvas_objects (id, board_id, type, data, position, created_by)
users (id, email, name, avatar_url, created_at)
collaborators (board_id, user_id, role, joined_at)
comments (id, board_id, user_id, content, created_at)
templates (id, name, category, data, created_by)
```

### Real-time Subscriptions
- Board changes
- Cursor positions
- User presence
- Comments/mentions

## API Design

### REST Endpoints
```
/api/boards - CRUD operations
/api/canvas - Object management
/api/templates - Template operations
/api/export - PDF/PNG generation
/api/health - System status
```

### WebSocket Events
```
canvas:update - Object changes
cursor:move - Cursor positions
user:join/leave - Presence
comment:add - New comments
```

4. International expansion

## Success Criteria

### Consolidation Success Metrics
- ✅ All 13 PRs resolved (merged or closed)
- ✅ Zero security vulnerabilities
- ✅ Single WebGL implementation chosen
- ✅ 100% test pass rate
- ✅ Clean main branch with no conflicts
- ✅ All features accessible from main

### Production Readiness Metrics
- Load handling: 1000+ canvas objects

## Conclusion

The Miro Clone has all required features implemented but they are trapped across 13 unmerged pull requests. This creates a **critical technical debt crisis** that blocks all progress. The architecture is sound and features are complete, but an immediate consolidation effort is required before any new development can proceed.

**Priority: RESOLVE PR CRISIS FIRST - No new features until consolidation complete**
